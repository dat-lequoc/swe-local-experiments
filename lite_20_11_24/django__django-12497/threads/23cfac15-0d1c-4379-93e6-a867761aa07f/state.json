    "issue_analysis": "The issue involves incorrect error hints in Django's ManyToManyField when there are multiple foreign keys in an intermediary model. The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with symmetrical=False and through parameters, which are actually ManyToManyField parameters. Additionally, symmetrical=False is outdated since Django 3.0. We've attempted to fix the error detection logic but are encountering test environment setup issues.",
    "next_steps": "1. Fix the test environment setup by correctly configuring the app registry and INSTALLED_APPS\n2. Update the test to use the correct app label\n3. Verify that the error detection logic works correctly\n4. Complete the implementation of the fix\n5. Run all tests to ensure no regressions",
