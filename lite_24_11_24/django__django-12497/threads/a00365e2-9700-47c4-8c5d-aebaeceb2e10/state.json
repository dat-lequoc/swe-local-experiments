      "3. Created test environment with proper Django app structure",
      "4. Created reproduce_error.py to test the error message and hint",

The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with symmetrical=False and through parameters, which are ManyToManyField parameters. We have set up a test environment but are encountering test failures that need to be resolved.",
