Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nModeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels\nConsider the following model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom astropy.modeling import models as m\r\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\r\n\r\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(cm)\r\narray([[ True, False],\r\n       [False,  True]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I make the model more complex:\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\r\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [False, False,  True, False],\r\n       [False, False, False,  True]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.\r\n\r\nIf however, I nest these compound models:\r\n```python\r\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)\r\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\r\n       [False, False,  True,  True],\r\n       [False, False,  True,  True]])\r\n```\r\nSuddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?\r\n\r\nThis feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- Your task is to make changes to the non-test files in the `/testbed` directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\n- Analyze the issue thoroughly before making any changes.\n- After EVERY tool use, use <CHECK> to analyze the output and determine next steps.\n- Ensure that your changes do not affect existing test cases. **Do not modify any existing test files; you can read them.**\n- After picking the best solution, implement the fix directly to the code base before creating and running any reproduce or tests.\n- Only after implementing the fix and ensuring existing tests pass, create your own scripts (e.g., `reproduce_error.py`, `edge_cases.py`) to test if the fix is working and to handle edge cases.

Explore `/testbed` and find files related to the issue.\n2. Expand the search scope to related files; you may view multiple files at once.\n3.
