      "[x] Consider multiple possible solutions, propose solutions, and pick the best one",
      "[x] Implement the fix directly to the code base, updating related parts of the code accordingly",

      "2. Located and examined relevant files: base.py and options.py in django/db/models/",
      "3. Found the root cause in ModelBase.__new__ where ordering inheritance doesn't properly handle direction prefixes",
      "4. Proposed three solutions with increasing comprehensiveness",
      "5. Implemented the most comprehensive solution that handles all types of ordering expressions",
      "6. Attempted to create test scripts but encountered environment setup issues",
      "7. The fix has been implemented but testing is incomplete"

    "issue_analysis": "The issue occurs when a child model inherits from a parent model that has ordering specified with a direction prefix (e.g., '-pk'). The ordering direction is not being properly preserved in the inheritance process. This happens because the ordering is being copied directly from the parent class without properly handling the direction prefix and other ordering attributes.",
    "next_steps": "1. Complete the test environment setup\n2. Create and run the reproduce_error.py script\n3. Add edge case tests\n4. Verify the fix works with existing test cases\n5. Submit the fix",
